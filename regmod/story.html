            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Subject of the work presented here is the web deployment, expansion and validation of a model for the reconstruction 
                of monthly aggregated areal temperature data from historical sources, as it is described by <a href="https://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/7904">Riemann, (2010)</a>.</p><br>
            <p>
                To this end, the model has been programmed in R-Statistics and linked on an Ubuntu server to a PostgreSQL database with 
                PostGIS extensions. The raster data which is calculated by the model is loaded into the database by using GDAL, where 
                they are stored in WKB format. Based on this, a web application has been developed, which dynamically retrieves the 
                calculated data using PHP and JavaScript from the database and uses leaflet.js for map visualization. In addition, individual 
                elements have been created which inform the user directly about the underlying data and offer him the opportunity to make spatial 
                and temporal selections. A direct validation of the calculated data is ensured by the provision and integration of the GHCNMV3 
                record <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/">(GHCNV3, 2015)</a>. The recalculation of the model by part selecting individual events of a month is made possible by linking 
                the web application with a Python-Skript, which process the requested data on the fly. Moreover, additional interfaces have been 
                developed in R and Python for the further development and collaborative cooperation.
