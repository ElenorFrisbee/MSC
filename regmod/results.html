                Through the model 1195 individual data records for 817 different months were calcu-lated on the basis of the available monthly temperature 
                indices from tambora. A validation of the reconstructed temperature distributions with data of GHCNMV3 and GMD (updated after Rapp, 2010) 
                showed an average deviation of 0.6&deg;C with a standard deviation of 2.8&deg;C between the reconstructed temperature fields and the GHCNMV3 data, 
                as well as an average deviation of 0.7&deg;C with a standard deviation of 2.06&deg;C to the GMD records. By cross-validation different monthly event 
                combinations were tested for correspondence with the respective validation data. Hereby, events could be identified, which deteriorate the 
                reconstructed temperatures in terms of compliance with the validation data. By omitting these events an average deviation of 0.03&deg;C with a 
                standard deviation of 1.98&deg;C between the reconstructed temperature fields and the GHCNMV3 data, as well as an average deviation of 0.61&deg;C with 
                a standard deviation of 1.81&deg;C to the GMD data was achieved.
                The comparison of the combinations of events with the best match to the respective validation data set showed, that 67.65% of the combinations 
                of events were identical between the two validation datasets.
